tcp_wrappers for Rocky8
-----------------------
- Required for channel (a.k.a. rocks-channel).
- Included in EPEL 8, but for whatever reason without tcp_wrappers-devel package.
- Therefore, rebuild for ROCKS8 with modified SPEC-file.
- Source: https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/8/Everything/SRPMS/Packages/t/tcp_wrappers-7.6-96.el8.src.rpm
- tcp_wrappers.spec.in triggers the old Rocks build style with provided spec files (see Rules-linux-centos.mk).
- Current RPM-release is 97 (in orde to superseed the original tcp_wrappers-7.6-96 from EPEL 8).
